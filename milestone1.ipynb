    "Since its creation in the nineteenth century, tennis has kept increasing in popularity to become one of the most played sports, and one of the most mediatized. You cannot ignore the names of the best figures such as Rafael Nadal or Novak Djokovic that compete in the unmissable Grand Slam tournaments: from Roland Garros to Wellington.\n",
    "Nonetheless, the usual picture of tennis shared by the media tends to focus on a tiny subset of both the events and the players.\n",
    "With this visualization, we want to give a holistic image of the community of professional tennis players, its global structure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we want to visualize the pattern of matchmaking through tournaments and through the seasons. All the tournaments can be seen as a graph whose nodes are the players and the edges are the tennis matches. We want to visualize the structure of this graph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the competitions, we would focus on individual players: besides the well-known superstars, what is the usual career of a professional tennis player, what are his characteristics? We want to share the stories of the ones whose names will never appear in any international headlines, while they make up the biggest chunk of the community.  \n",
    "Those questions, such as the role of right or left handedness, are the subject of common discussions. Through the use of data visualization, we aim at shedding new light on these topics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization is intended for the general public, with no particular interest in tennis. Our goal is to show the fascinating patterns that emerge in the data visualization from this field and to share the statistical stories that never appear in newspapers."

    "Our idea is original in the sense that it aims to show much more the links between players and countries. The way of approaching the data is therefore different. Our ambitions for the moment are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Tab 1*: Network between players:**\n",
    "    - Make a network that connects players who have played a match. Interactivity: you can move the nodes with the mouse to make the network move.\n",
    "    - A node corresponds to a player (with the picture of the player in the node). The bigger the node, the more matches the player has made. \n",
    "    - Network oriented to know who is the winner.\n",
    "    - Slider to choose the year.\n",
    "    - Button to apply filters according to different variables: Location, Tournament, Serie, Court, Surface, Players ranking range.\n",
    "    - When hovering a summary of information is displayed with a possibility to click on an extension. This extension is a whole page about the player is displayed with: his picture, the number of matches played in ATP by series per year, the number of wins and the number of losses according to the year/the tournament/the type of court/the type of surface, his nationality, his weight, his year of start as a pro and his playing hand. There is also a planisphere that can be rotated and where the points of the tournaments in which he participated by year are displayed (inspiration: https://observablehq.com/@d3/world-tour or https://observablehq.com/@d3/versor-dragging). Also, a list with his main opponents. \n",
    "    - It is also possible to click on the link between the two players: a box is displayed with the characteristics of the matches: their photo, location, tournament, date, series, court, surface, round, winner, rank and points of the players at the beginning of the tournament, number of games won by each player for each set, number of sets won by each player, comment, odds.\n",
    "    - Inspiration: http://www.claudiobellei.com/2017/02/04/viznetworks/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Tab 2*: Connection map between countries:**\n",
    "    - World map with the countries colored according to for example the number of victories of theirs players.\n",
    "    - Link between the countries whose players play each other in a match.\n",
    "    - Slider to choose the year.\n",
    "    - Button to apply filters according to different variables: Location, Tournament, Serie, Court, Surface, Players ranking range.\n",
    "    - Possibility to click on a country: a box appears with the list of players of the country and the number of matches of each one for this year with their number of victories.\n",
    "    - You can also click on the links between the countries: a box with the characteristics of the match is displayed with : location, tournament, date, series, court, surface, round, winner, rank and points of the players at the beginning of the tournament, number of games won by each for each set, number of sets won by each, comment, odds.\n",

    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Tab 3*: Bart Charts with bars that move over time:**\n",
    "    - Two bart charts on the same line with the bars moving as the years go by.\n",
    "    - A first bart chart to show the evolution of the countries ranking in terms of number of wins. \n",
    "    - A second bart chart to show the evolution of the players in terms of number of wins.\n",
    "    - Button to apply filters according to different variables: Series, Court, Surface.\n",
    "    - Inspiration: https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart-race  \n",

    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "- ***(Side ideas for the site)***:\n",
    "    - Make the loading symbol in the form of a spinning tennis ball.\n",
    "    - Make a mascot in the form of a tennis racket to explain the site's features at the beginning.\n",
    "    - Make symbols for the selection of variables, a small cup for the winner, flags for the nationalities, etc...  \n",
